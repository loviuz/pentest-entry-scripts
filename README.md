# Pentest Entry Scripts
A collection of ready-to-use scripts to do recon and penetration testing on targets. Use ONLY on own or authorized systems.

# How to use
These scripts should be executed in order.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loviuz/pentest-entry-scripts.git
cd pentest-entry-scripts/
chmod +x *.sh```
```

Edit the **config** file to configure the host to scan:

```bash
# Target domain (only domain, without http)
host="127.0.0.1"

# Target protocol ("http" or "https")
protocol="http"

# Target path (starting with /)
path="/DVWA/"

# Select the browser to use for viewing scan results
browser="firefox"

# If you need a cookie, please specificy it here
cookie=""
```

Launch every scripts, and enjoy :-)

```bash
./0-prepare.sh
./1-recon.sh
./2-web-discovery.sh
```
